# CGD-R-theme
A ggplot2 theme for CGD graphs

This is a script to implement CGD's [branding and data viz guidelines](https://centerforglobaldevelop.sharepoint.com/:b:/r/sites/fileshare/Shared%20Documents/NDrive/Communications/CGD%20Branding%20Materials/CGD-Data-Viz-Style-Guide.pdf?csf=1&web=1&e=H081DY) on ggplot graphs. There are other versions of this script floating around, but the point of this repository is to serve as the canonical version.
